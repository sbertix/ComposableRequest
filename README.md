**ComposableRequest** is a library abstracting away **URLSession**, using Swift syntax at its finest.\
Starting in [**Swiftagram**](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram), **ComposableRequest** is now a fully fledged library on its own.

> Where can I use this?

**ComposableRequest** supports **iOS**, **macOS**, **watchOS**, **tvOS** and **Linux**.

## Installation
### Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11 and above)
1. Select `File`/`Swift Packages`/`Add Package Dependencyâ€¦` from the menu.
1. Paste `https://github.com/sbertix/ComposableRequest.git`.
1. Follow the steps.

`Requestable` also defines custom [`Publisher`](https://sbertix.github.io/ComposableRequest/Structs/PaginatablePublisher.html)s when linking against the [**Combine**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) framework.

> Why not CocoaPods, or Carthage, or ~blank~?

Supporting multiple _dependency managers_ makes maintaining a library exponentially more complicated and time consuming.\
Furthermore, with the integration of the **Swift Package Manager** in **Xcode 11** and greater, we expect the need for alternative solutions to fade quickly.

## Usage
Visit the (_auto-generated_) [Documentation](https://sbertix.github.io/ComposableRequest) to learn about use cases, or check out [**Swiftagram**](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram) for implementation details.
