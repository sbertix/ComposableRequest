<br />

**ComposableRequest** is a networking layer based on a declarative interface, written in (modern) **Swift**.

It abstracts away `URLSession` implementation, in order to provide concise and powerful endpoint representations, thanks to the power of **Combine** `Publisher`s. 
Compatibilty for older versions of **iOS**, **macOS**, **tvOS** and **watchOS** is provided through **CombineX**'s **CXShim**, learn more [here](https://github.com/cx-org/CombineX/wiki/Combine-Compatible-Package).

It comes with `Storage` (inside of **ComposableStorage**), a way of caching `Storable` items, and related concrete implementations (e.g. `UserDefaultsStorage`, `KeychainStorage` – for which you're gonna need to add **ComposableStorageCrypto**, depending on [**Swiftchain**](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftchain), together with the ability to provide the final user of your API wrapper to inject code through `Provider`s.

> What's next?

**ComposableRequest** was initially [**Swiftagram**](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram)'s networking layer and it still tends to follow roughly the same development cycle. 

[Milestones](https://github.com/sbertix/ComposableRequest/milestones), [issues](https://github.com/sbertix/ComposableRequest/issues), are the best way to keep updated with active developement.

## Installation
### Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11 and above)
1. Select `File`/`Swift Packages`/`Add Package Dependency…` from the menu.
1. Paste `https://github.com/sbertix/ComposableRequest.git`.
1. Follow the steps.
1. Add **ComposableStorage** together with **ComposableRequest** for the full experience.

> Why not CocoaPods, or Carthage, or ~blank~?

Supporting multiple _dependency managers_ makes maintaining a library exponentially more complicated and time consuming.\
Furthermore, with the integration of the **Swift Package Manager** in **Xcode 11** and greater, we expect the need for alternative solutions to fade quickly.

<details><summary><strong>Targets</strong></summary>
    <p>

- **ComposableRequest**, an HTTP client originally integrated in **Swiftagram**, the core library.\
It depends on [**CombineX**](https://github.com/cx-org/CombineX/)'s [**CXShim**](https://github.com/cx-org/CombineX/wiki/Combine-Compatible-Package) to provide **Combine** support on all platforms, reguardless of their minum deployment version. 

- **ComposableStorage**, can be imported together with **ComposableRequest** to extend its functionality.

## Usage
Check out [**Swiftagram**](https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram) or visit the (_auto-generated_) [Documentation](https://sbertix.github.io/ComposableRequest) to learn about use cases.  

### Endpoint

As an implementation example, we can display some code related to the Instagram endpoint tasked with deleting a post.

```swift
/// A `module`-like `enum`.
public enum MediaEndpoint {
    /// Delete one of your own posts, matching `identifier`.
    /// Checkout https://github.com/sbertix/Swiftagram for more info.
    ///
    /// - parameter identifier: String
    /// - returns: A locked `AnyObservable`, waiting for authentication `HTTPCookie`s.
    public func delete(_ identifier: String) -> LockSessionProvider<[HTTPCookie], AnyPublisher<Bool, Error>> {
        // Wait for user defined values.
        LockSessionProvider { cookies, session in
            // Defer it so it only resumes when observed.
            Deferred {
                // Fetch first info about the post to learn if it's a video or picture
                // as they have slightly different endpoints for deletion.
                Request("https://i.instagram.com/api/v1/media")
                    .path(appending: identifier)
                    .info   // Equal to `.path(appending: "info")`.
                    // Wait for the user to `inject` an array of `HTTPCookie`s.
                    // You should implement your own `model` to abstract away
                    // authentication cookies, but as this is just an example
                    // we leave it to you.
                    .header(appending: HTTPCookie.requestHeaderFields(with: cookies))
                    // Create the `Publisher`.
                    .publish(with: session)
                    // Check it returned a valid media.
                    .map(\.data)
                    // Decode it inside a `Wrapper`, allowing to interrogate JSON
                    // representations of object without knowing them in advance.
                    // (It's literally the missing `AnyCodable`).
                    .wrap()
                    // Prepare the new request.
                    .flatMap { wrapper -> AnyPublisher<Bool, Error> in
                        guard let type = wrapper["items"][0].mediaType.int(),
                              [1, 2, 8].contains(type) else {
                            return Just(false).setFailureType(to: Failure.self).eraseToAnyPublisher()
                        }
                        // Actually delete it now that we have all data.
                        return Request("https://i.instagram.com/api/v1/media")
                            .path(appending: identifier)
                            .path(appending: "delete/")
                            .query(appending: type == 2 ? "VIDEO" : "PHOTO", forKey: "media_type")
                            // This will be applied exactly as before, but you can add whaterver
                            // you need to it, as it will only affect this `Request`.
                            .header(appending: HTTPCookie.requestHeaderFields(with: cookies))
                            // Create the `Publisher`.
                            .publish(with: session)
                            .map(\.data)
                            .wrap()
                            .map { $0.status == "ok" }
                    }
            }
            // Make sure it's observed from the main thread.
            .receive(on: .main)
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

> How can the user then retreieve the information?

All the user has to do is…

```swift
/// A valid post identifier.
let identifier: String = /* a valid String */
/// A valid array of cookies.
let cookies: [HTTPCookie] = /* an array of HTTPCookies */
/// A *retained* collection of `AnyCancellable`s.
var bin: Set<AnyCancellable> = []

/// Delete it.
MediaEndpoint.delete(identifier)
    .unlock(with: cookies)
    .session(.shared)
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { _ in }, receiveValue: { print($0) })
    .store(in: &bin)
```

<br />

### Resume and cancel requests

> What about cancelling the request, or starting it a later date?

As **ComposableRequest** is based on the **Combine** runtime, you can simply `cancel` the `Cancellable` returned on `sink`, or emptying the "dispose bag"-like `Set` you've stored it in. 

### Caching
Caching of `Storable`s is provided through conformance to the `Storage` protocol, specifically by implementing either `ThrowingStorage` or `NonThrowingStorage`.  

The library comes with several concrete implementations.  
- `TransientStorage` should be used when no caching is necessary, and it's what `Authenticator`s default to when no `Storage` is provided.  
- `UserDefaultsStorage` allows for faster, out-of-the-box, testing, although it's not recommended for production as private cookies are not encrypted.  
- `KeychainStorage`, requiring you to add **ComposableStorageCrypto**, (**preferred**) stores them safely in the user's keychain.
